# Introduction
This document aims to explain what you can do with TTX-Cloud.

## Why use TTX-Cloud? 
Architects and Engineers need to utilize a variety of 3D modeling platforms in order to iterate through the building design process. 
This leads to large amounts of disparate information, which becomes increasingly difficult to manage. 

### We developed TTX-cloud to host the single source of truth for BIM data
TTX-Cloud is a cloud-based platform that enables version control and design collaboration across multiple BIM and analysis programs.

### Interoperabilty
Every 3D modeling program has a different way to represent building elements. TTX unique focus is on bi-directional synchronization of data and geometry between the various programs while respecting the various standards.

###Version Control
Every architectural project undergoes many design iterations. To date no software exists to manage these. TTX-Cloud is developed to keep track of every decision during the design process.

###Model Insight
3D models contain lots of inaccessible information. TTX brings transparency into the design process by offering insight through querying, visualizing, comparing and modifying model data.
