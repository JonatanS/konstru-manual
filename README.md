# What is Konstru?

Architects and Structural Engineers use a variety of 3D modeling platforms in order to iterate through the building design process. These different software packages are not interoperable, so engineers cannot share a model built in Revit with someone working on that same model in Tekla. Konstru is a cloud-based platform that enables version control, design collaboration, user permission control, and model comparison across multiple BIM and analysis programs.

## Interoperability

Every 3D modeling program has a different way to represent building elements. Konstru synchronizes analysis data and geometry between various modeling programs, while respecting their specific standards. More details [here](supported_elements.md).

## Version Control

Every architectural project undergoes many design iterations. Konstru is developed to keep track of every decision during the design process.

## Model Insight

3D models contain lots of inaccessible information. Konstru brings transparency into the design process by offering insight through querying, visualizing, comparing and modifying model data.
