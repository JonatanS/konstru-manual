# Supported Elements

Konstru supports a range of new elements and platforms. The following tables show all supported elements by platform and IN or OUT direction. Where IN = able to read from Konstru to the platform and OUT = writing to Konstru.

Interoperability for materials is still limited because each platform has a different level of detail on materials.  However you can easily read and write materials within each platform. For example, Revit Materials will work fine from Revit to Revit.

Excel and Grasshopper work differently on materials and profiles. They don't have materials internally. You can access all materials and profiles existing in the model on both platforms and use them to edit or create elements.
