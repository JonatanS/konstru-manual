# Installation

Konstru is a web application that you access in your web browser. Konstru connects to Revit, SAP2000, ETABS, Rhino, Tekla, RAM or Excel using our provided msi-installers, or plugins, which can be downloaded from [app.konstru.com/downloadplugins](http://app.konstru.com/downloadPlugins) once you have logged in to your Konstru account. These plugins function just like other downloadable software. Download, then double click the .msi file and follow the instructions:

# Run Konstru

After completing the installation process, you will find the Konstru plugin installed to either its own menu bar \(Revit and Tekla\), the tools menu \(SAP and Etabs\), addins menu tab \(Excel\), or as a standalone application \(RAM\).
