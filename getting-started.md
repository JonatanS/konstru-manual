#Getting Started

##1. Create a User Account
Go to **https://ttx-webapp.herokuapp.com/** and sign up with your TT email address.
The TTX-Cloud web application works best in a Chrome browser, but also in Firefox and Internet Explorer (IE being the slowest of the three).

##2. Create a Project

Click the large green button to create a new project. Choose a name and description.

**Project Name:** Should be a high level designation, such as the name of the TT Project. Analogous to the TT Project Number.

**Project Description:** A short meaningful description. 

When you create a new project, a new model named 'Master Model' is automatically created.

##3. Upload a Model

TTX-Cloud uses the same UI for each of the seven desktop apps. In the desktop application (in my case Revit), select the project, and then the model ('Master Model'). Then press 'Select Model'.


##4. Add Collaborators
