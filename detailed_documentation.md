# Detailed Documentation

##Permission Levels:
We have 3 permission levels (Admin, Write and Read) for both Projects and Models.

A Project Admin has the highest privilege. Typically, for any given project, there should only be one or two admins.
Collaborators with Project Write Permissions can create new models. They are automatically assigned admin rights for their created models.
Collaborators with Write access to models can upload new versions from any desktop application.
